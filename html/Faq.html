                        <p>Climate change is the change in the climate of a place over a period of time. Most of it has
                            been brought up by human activities taking place on a daily basis that harm the environment.
                            Examples of the same include industrialisation that leads to emission of smoke ,the burning
                            of litter, cutting down of trees etc.</p>
