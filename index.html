                    That is considered the upper limit to avoid the worst fallout from climate change.These increase in temperatures

                    making it hard for farmers to know better planting seasons hence altering supply of food.
                    Deforestation can cause a vicious cycle  because the act of deforestation drive climate change,
                     which in turn hurts the food production of
                     existing farmland and motivates farmers to cut down more trees in order to meet quotas, Thus leading to
                     more Deforestaion.

                        One of the most dangerous and unsettling effects of deforestation is the loss of animal and plant species due to their loss of habitat. 70% of land animals and plant species live in forests. Not only does deforestation threaten species known to us, but also those unknown.
                        The trees of the rainforest that provide shelter for some species also provide the canopy that regulates the temperature. Deforestation results in a more drastic temperature variation from day to night, much like a desert, which could prove fatal for many inhabitants.

                        Further effects of deforestation include soil erosion and coastal flooding. Trees help the land to retain water and topsoil, which provides the rich nutrients to sustain additional forest life.

                        Without forests, the soil erodes and washes away, causing farmers to move on and perpetuate the cycle. The barren land which is left behind in the wake of these unsustainable agricultural practices is then more susceptible to flooding, specifically in coastal regions.

                    Trees found in urban environments often serve architectural and engineering functions by providing privacy, emphasizing views or obstructing objectionable views. With proper selection and maintenance, even trees on private property can provide benefits to the community. Trees provide privacy, accentuate views, reduce noise and glare, and even enhance architecture. Trees also bring natural elements and wildlife habitats into urban surroundings, all of which increase the quality of life for residents in the community.

                    Trees alter our environment by using their leaves to filter the air we breathe by removing dust and other particles. Deciduous shade trees cool homes in the summer and allow the winter sun to heat homes when they lose their leaves. Trees can serve as a windbreak. The more compact the foliage on the group of trees the more effective the windbreak. Trees add beuty to the enviroment. 
                    They also provide shade to humans, 
                    food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals..

                        1. The trunk flare is where the trunk expands at the base of the tree. Ensure trunk flare is partially visible after the tree is planted. Remove excess soil prior to planting if flare is not visible. <br>
                  
                        2. Dig a shallow, broad planting hole. Holes should be 2–3 times wider than the root ball, but only as deep as the root ball. <br> 
                          
                        3. If wrapped, remove any cover from around the root ball and trunk to facilitate root growth. Remove wire basket or cut one or two rings off so it is low-profile and will not interfere with future root growth.
                    ect tree root ball for circling roots and straighten, cut, or remove them. Expose the trunk flare if necessary. <br>  
                          
                        4. Place the tree at the proper height. When placing the tree in the hole, lift by the root ball, not the trunk. The majority of tree’s roots develop in the top 12 inches (30 cm) of soil. Planting too deep can be harmful to the tree. <br> 
                          
                        5. Straighten the tree in the hole. Before filling the hole, have someone examine the tree from several angles to confirm it is straight. <br>  
                          
                        6. Fill the hole gently but firmly. Pack soil around the base of the root ball to stabilize it. 
                     the hole firmly to eliminate air pockets. Further reduce air pockets by watering periodically while backfilling. Avoid fertilizing at the time of planting. <br> 
                          
                        7. If staking is necessary, three stakes or underground systems provide optimum support. Studies have shown that trees develop stronger trunks and roots if they are not staked; however, it may be required when planting bare root stock or on windy sites. Remove stakes after first year of growth. <br> 
                          
                        8. Mulch the base of the tree. Place a 2–3 inch (5–7.5 cm) layer of mulch, but be sure not to pile much right against the trunk. A mulch-free area of 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) wide at the base of the tree will reduce moist bark and prevent decay. <br> 
                          
                         Provide follow-up care. Keep the soil moist by watering at least once a week, barring rain, and more frequently during hot, windy weather. Continue until mid-fall, tapering off as lower temperatures require less-frequent watering. <br>
